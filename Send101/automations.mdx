It's like subscribing to a service and getting notified whenever something happens.

When someone interacts with your content (views a page, downloads a file, etc.), [send.co](http://send.co) immediately sends that information to any tool you've connected via webhook.

## How to use Webhooks

1. [******In send.co:******](http://send.co) Click 'Add Webhook'

   ![Add a Webhook - Step 1.png](/images/AddaWebhook-Step1.png)
2. **In your automation tool:**

- Open your chosen tool (Zapier, Make, etc.)
- Look for "Webhook" or "HTTP Request" trigger

<Info>
  **Note:** not all tools offer the Webhooks feature for free.

  If you’re just getting started, [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is a great alternative that lets you create AI-powered workflows for free.

3. When setting up your webhook, make sure to select “POST” as the method so your information is sent correctly.

> **Note:** We send a separate event for each file you have. If you want to focus on a specific file, you can add a filter in your workflow to handle just the files you're interested in. This is useful when you only want to process or respond to certain files.

## What data is sent in Webhooks

When someone interacts with your [send.co](http://send.co) content, we automatically send the following information:

**Event Information:**

- Event type (e.g., "linkViewed")
- Timestamp of when the action occurred

**Viewer Details:**

- Name (when available)
- Email address (when available)
- Phone number (when available)

**Location Data:**

- Country
- Region/State
- City

**Device Information:**

- Device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
- Browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)
- Operating system (macOS, Windows, iOS, Android)

**Link Details:**

- Link ID (unique identifier)
- [send.co](http://send.co) link URL
- Original document URL

---

The data is sent in a format called JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON is simply a way to organize information so that computers and different apps can easily read and use it. Each piece of information, such as the viewer’s name, location, or device type, is clearly labeled and grouped together.

**Here’s an example of what the data looks like for a “link viewed” event:**

```json
"event": "linkViewed",
"timestamp": "2024-03-20T10:30:00Z",
"data": {
"viewer": {
"name": "Neil Gandhi",
"email": "neil@paage.io",
"phone": "+1234567890"
},
"location": {
"country": "United States",
"region": "California",
"city": "San Francisco"
},
"device": {
"type": "Desktop",
"browser": "Chrome",
"os": "macOS"
},
"linkId": "abc123",
"linkUrl": "<https://www.send.co/a/abc123>",
"originalUrl": "<https://docs.google.com/proposal>"
}
}
```
