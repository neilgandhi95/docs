## How to identify viewers

### Asking for name, email, or phone number

Your content is ungated by default. You can ask for name, email, or phone anytime.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to settings">

    After uploading a file or pasting a link, go to settings, and you'll see three toggles to activate:

    - Name
    - Email
    - Phone
  </Step>

### Personalized links

Want to identify users without asking for their data? Then create custom links.

To understand how they work, check out our links section.

**How to create a Personalized Link**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Personalized Links">
    After uploading a file or pasting a link, go to 'Personalized Links'

    ![Custom Links Pn](/images/CustomLinks.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Personalize your link">
    Add unique identifiers - whether it's for specific people (like 'Neil'), campaigns ('Q1-launch'), channels ('linkedin'), or any other way you want to segment your tracking.

  <Step title="Example of tracking using links">
    This is the magic: the viewer is shown as 'Anonymous', but you actually know it's `Neil from San Francisco`who spent `1m 44s`  going through your slides.

    All without asking for a single piece of information.

## When to ask for information?

Based on your relationship stage, you can consider gating your content.

Send gives you location data and engagement signals even when people don't fill out forms.

Combine that with custom links for specific prospects or campaigns, and you can piece together who's engaging, even without forms.

### **Cold prospects**

Don't ask for anything yet. You haven't built trust, so Send automatically captures their location and engagement data - you can still identify them without the friction. Use custom links for specific users or campaigns to get even better hints about who's visiting.

### **If you already have context**

ike someone clicked from your social media post, attended your webinar, or found a resource on your website, it's okay to ask for their name and email.

They've shown interest and have some context about who you are.

### **After calls or meetings**

Ask for their name. You've established a relationship, so you can uncover hidden stakeholders and actually track if they share with their team.

_They said "I'll share this with my team" - now you'll know if they do._

Start anonymously and get smarter over time.

<Tip>
  Tip: When gating content, be honest about why. People should understand they're getting something genuinely useful, not just another PDF anyone could access.
</Tip>

## Follow up with value

**Instead of sending "Did you see my proposal?" emails** → _Boring and not relevant, and probably will be ignored._

**Use engagement data to craft follow-ups that bring something new to the table:**

![Section Insight Pn](/images/SectionInsight.png)

- If someone spent time on your pricing page, don't ask if they saw it - send them a **custom ROI calculator**
- If they viewed your case studies, share a **relevant success story** from their industry

**For example,** suppose I'm selling Send, rather than just following up on a proposal. In that case, I can create a **live Send account** for prospects with their own branded example using their company name and industry-specific content.

_This way, I'm not just following up; I'm advancing the conversation with something they actually want to engage with._
