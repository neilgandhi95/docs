## Why use Personalized Links?

Personalized links let you identify anonymous visitors without asking for their information, even when they don't fill out forms.

## How Personalized Links work:

**Every link gets a unique ID** (like`U8Ny6KWh`In the example). 

You can then add any custom prefix to create personalized links:

- Add prefixes like `principles-`, `linkedin-guide-`, or `pitch-deck-`
- Result: `https://send.co/a/principles-U8Ny6KWh`

  <Step title="Example of tracking using links">
    This is the magic: the viewer is shown as 'Anonymous', but you actually know it's `Neil from San Francisco`who spent `1m 44s`  going through your slides.

    All without asking for a single piece of information.
