## Understanding all metrics and signals available

### **Who opened it**

We track location automatically. Want names, emails, and phone numbers? Just flip the toggles in settings. [**See the identity section**](https://paage.mintlify.app/Send101/identify) for the full breakdown on when to use each

- **Name**: Ask when you have some context (webinars, content downloads)
- **Email**: Ask when they show interest (demos, resources)
- **Phone**: Ask only to high value prospects
- **Location** (by default): Always tracked by Send.

### How engaged they were

- **Time spent**: Time spent viewing the document. If they close or change tabs, we stop counting.
- **Number of opens**: We register every time someone opens the document.
- **Which parts did they read** (PDF files only): We track time spent on each page so you know if they read it all or focused on specific sections.

### **Live activity**

Watch in real-time as they go through your document. 

Your dashboard shows real-time activity as it happens. Look for the green "Viewing" status next to any visitor currently reading your content.
