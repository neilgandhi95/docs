## Understanding all metrics and signals available

### **Who opened it**

We track location automatically. Want names, emails, and phone numbers? Just flip the toggles in settings. [**See the identity section**](https://paage.mintlify.app/Send101/identify) for the full breakdown on when to use each

- **Name**: Ask when you have some context (webinars, content downloads)
- **Email**: Ask when they show interest (demos, resources)
- **Phone**: Ask  to high-value prospects
- **Location** (by default): Always tracked by Send.

### How engaged they were

- **Time spent**: Time spent viewing the document. If they close or change tabs, we stop counting.
- **Number of opens**: We register every time someone opens the document.
- **Which parts did they read** (PDF files only): We track time spent on each page so you know if they read it all or focused on specific sections.

### **Live activity**

Watch in real-time as they go through your document.

Your dashboard shows real-time activity as it happens. Look for the green "Viewing" status next to any visitor currently reading your content.

See exactly when they open it, how long they stay on each page, and when they close it.

**What can you do with this?**

Timing and context are everything. You'll know exactly when to follow up.

### Instant alerts

Get an email the second someone opens your content.

Perfect for time-sensitive deals or when you need to be available for questions.

**Pro tip:** Use live activity to time your follow-up calls.

See them spending 10 minutes on your case studies? Call them or send a relevant message minutes after they finish reading.

## Turn Signals Into Actions

We've developed a simple process that turns every engagement signal into the right response. Four steps: Signals, Enrichment, Frequency, Intent.

Sounds fancy, but it's really just paying attention to the right things in the right order.

1. **Signals** (what they actually did with your content)
2. **Enrichment** (who they really are via Clay/Apollo/CRM)
3. **Frequency** (how often they're engaging)
4. **Intent** (what action to take based on the data)

Instead of sending "Did you see my proposal?" to everyone, you know exactly who to call, when to call them, and what to say

## **How we actually do this**

**Start with the signal.** What did they actually do? Not what you think they did, but what the data shows. 6 minutes on case studies. 8 minutes on pricing. Currently viewing your demo video. The behavior tells you their headspace.

**Then add context.** Anonymous visitor from Austin doesn't mean much. Marketing director at a Series B fintech from Austin? Now we're talking.

You can run automated enrichment, or you can even integrate Send to your CRM via Webhooks it takes a few minutes and helps you avoid sending generic follow ups that no one answers to.

**Check the pattern.** First visit? They're exploring. Third visit this week? They're evaluating. Multiple people from the same company? Buying committee is active. The frequency tells you urgency.

**Match your response to their intent.** Quick glance gets different treatment than deep engagement. Someone researching pricing gets different content than someone reading case studies.

### Automating the system

Start manual first. You need to understand what good signals look like before you automate responses or create systems.

Once you can spot high-intent signals without thinking about it, then automate the obvious stuff:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High-engagement alerts" icon="signal-stream">
    Set Send to ping you when someone spends 5\+ minutes on your content.

    For instance,  a Slack notification with the company name and engagement summary. Takes the guesswork out of which signals need immediate attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-enrichment for hot leads" icon="sparkles">
    Connect Send to Clay via webhook - when someone hits your engagement thresholds, Clay automatically enriches them and drops the data into your CRM. No more manual lookups for every signal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intent-based email sequences" icon="solar-system">
    Create different templates for pricing-focused visitors versus case-study readers versus quick browsers. When someone shows specific behavior patterns, they automatically get the relevant follow-up sequence.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The key is automating the routine stuff so you can focus on the conversations that matter. But if you automate before you understand the patterns, you'll just send irrelevant emails faster.
