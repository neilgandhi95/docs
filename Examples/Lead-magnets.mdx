## Sharing resources and gating content

Daniela was doing a sponsor campaign with Notion to give three free months of their PLUS plan with AI included. And she built a Notion template that she wanted to share with her audience on LinkedIn.

What she did was share the link to each person who wanted to receive the template.

The result was more than 300 comments, and she was able to track and engage with the leads that actually interacted with the document.

You can replicate this on LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube, and any social platform, and relevant interaction where you want to share resources.

## Ungated content

You don't always need forms or gates to drive results. Sometimes, freely sharing personalized content works even better.

Michael creates hyper-personalized landing pages using tools like Lovable, Bolt, or Replit, then shares them directly on LinkedIn without any gates.

When he shared these ungated landing pages directly on LinkedIn, he received around 200 visits.

Both ungated and "comment for access" approaches can yield success depending on the context.

You can replicate this approach using quick development tools and any social platform where you want to demonstrate expertise through freely accessible, personalized content.
