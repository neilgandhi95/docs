This section is inspired by a real customer who did this and achieved great results.

So basically, she was doing a sponsor campaign with Notion to give three free months of their PLUS plan with AI included. And she built a Notion template that she wanted to share with her audience on LinkedIn.

What she did was share the link to each person who wanted to receive the template.

The result was more than 300 comments, and she was able to track and engage with the leads that actually interacted with the document.

You can replicate this on LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube, and any social platform, and relevant interaction where you want to share resources.
