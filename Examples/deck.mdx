Most founders use data rooms that force VCs to create accounts in a new tool. But VCs want your actual Excel model, not a preview in some portal. They want to download your deck, not view it through a clunky interface.

Every extra step is friction you are creating unnecessarily.

Send lets you share your actual documents, the Excel model they want to analyze, the PowerPoint deck they'll present to partners, the Notion docs with your metrics. No forced platform adoption, no account creation, no learning curve.

<Tip>
   By enabling email capture, you can identify not only when the primary recipient views your documents but also track everyone they forward it to within the firm, giving you full visibility into how your materials are being shared and discussed.

You can create custom links for the different funds or angels and get notified each time they interact with your files. See when they spend serious time on your financials or dig deep into your metrics.

For instance, when multiple people from the same fund review materials, you know they're discussing internally. Follow up while you're top of mind instead of waiting weeks.
