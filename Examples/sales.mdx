### **Sales Proposals**

You sent your proposal three days ago. Did they open it? Are they sharing it internally? Should you follow up?

You either wait too long and lose momentum, or follow up too early with generic "checking in" messages that feel pushy.

Send tracks every proposal interaction and send you notifications so you know when a prospect is interacts with your proposal.

You can see metrics like how long they spend reading, and which sections they focus on.

For instance, when someone spends 10 minutes on pricing, you can follow up with ROI data. \
\
Or when they focus on case studies, you can send relevant success stories.

Or if multiple people from their company view it, you know they're sharing internally.

### **Cold prospects**

When doing outbound, we don't recommend you asking for any information upfront because you haven't built trust yet. But you still need to know who's engaging with your content and when to follow up.

Use Send's personalized links for every outbound prospect. Create custom links so you know exactly who viewed what, even without asking for anything.

**_You can still identify prospects and track engagement without any friction._**

When someone spends time on your content, follow up with perfect context instead of generic outreach.

### **After calls or meetings**

Ask for their name. You've established a relationship, so you can uncover hidden stakeholders and actually track if they share with their team.

_They said "I'll share this with my team" - now you'll know if they do._

Start anonymously and get smarter over time.

  Tip: When gating content, be honest about why. People should understand they're getting something genuinely useful, not just another PDF anyone could access.

## Follow up with value

**Instead of sending "Did you see my proposal?" emails** (_boring and not relevant, and probably will be ignored)_

**Use engagement data to craft follow-ups that bring something new to the table:**

- If someone spent time on your pricing page, don't ask if they saw it - send them a **custom ROI calculator**
- If they viewed your case studies, share a **relevant success story** from their industry

**For example,** suppose I'm selling Send, rather than just following up on a proposal. In that case, I can create a **live Send account** for prospects with their own branded example using their company name and industry-specific content.

_This way, I'm not just following up; I'm advancing the conversation with something they actually want to engage with._
