Webinars build trust and set the expectation of valuable follow-up. But once you share resources, it’s hard to know who’s truly interested so everyone gets the same follow-up.

Even though someone who spent 20 minutes reading your guide is clearly more engaged than someone who just downloaded it.

With _Send_, you can gate resources to collect names and emails, then track exactly who’s engaging deeply. But also, you can use Webhooks to send your data automatically into your CRM to enrich leads and trigger targeted sequences.

Now you can focus on leads who are showing real intent, not just those who showed up.
