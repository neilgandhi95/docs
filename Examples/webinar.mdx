Webinars are the perfect place to share resources: your audience has already received value and trusts you.

And you can take them to the next step, sharing additional content and **creating specific sequences for those who are engaging the most.**

What usually happens is everyone gets the same follow-up message, though someone who spent 20 minutes reading your guide is clearly more engaged than someone who just downloaded it.

With _Send_, you can gate resources to collect names and emails, then track exactly who’s engaging deeply. But also, you can use Webhooks to send your data automatically into your CRM to enrich leads and trigger targeted sequences.

Now you can focus on leads who are showing real intent, not just those who showed up.

Here are some ideas you can implement:

  <Accordion title="Send data to your CRM" icon="sparkles">
    Use Send to share webinar resources and capture both contact info and engagement data. Since you've established trust, gate the content to collect names and emails. 

    See exactly who's spending serious time with your materials. Send all interaction and engagement data to your CRM automatically and create rules to trigger specific sequences for high-engaged leads.

    For example: someone spends more than 3 minutes with your resource and is located in the United States - they automatically get dropped into your high-intent sequence. Someone who just downloads and leaves gets the standard nurture track.

  <Accordion title="Connecting on LinkedIn" icon="linkedin">
    When a webinar attendee downloads your gated resource, Send captures their name and email, then uses webhooks to trigger Clay or Apollo for LinkedIn profile enrichment. 

    Tools like Phantombuster or LinkedIn automation platforms can automatically send connection requests with personalized messages like: 

    "Hi [Name], saw you downloaded our implementation guide after the webinar. Since you spent time reviewing it, thought you might find this additional case study relevant to [their company]."

      You can also use Zapier to connect Send → Clay → your LinkedIn automation tool, creating a seamless follow-up that feels personal and timely while the webinar conversation is still warm.
